- Take a look at the images in [this ArtStor collection](http://library.artstor.org/group/909868?token=9Bu5gTahSqucSmR+6lN1hw). Select **three** images that grab your attention in some way. By the start of class on Friday, write 1-2 paragraphs on each of your three images (3-6 paragraphs, total), addressing the following questions:
	1. Why did you select this image? What specific aspects of this image grabbed your attention?
	2. How might an adherent of the religious tradition with which this piece is associated relate to it? How might a non-adherent relate to it?
