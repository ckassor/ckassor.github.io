# RLST 100 Course Syllabus

**What this course is:**
This course is an introduction to the academic study of religion, exploring cross-culturally some of the fundamental ways in which people experience and understand religion. Together we will address the following questions: What is religion? How is it understood and practiced in different parts of the world? What constitutes religious knowledge, and how is such knowledge acquired?

**What this course is _not_:**
This course is _not_ a survey of world religions, although you will gain some insights into some of the ways that different religious traditions are understood and practiced around the world. This course will be fun, but it is not going to be easy! This is a 100-level course, which means that there are no prerequisites. I am assuming that no one here has any prior experience with religious studies, but this doesn’t mean that it’s going to be easier than an upper-level course. All students are expected to prepare adequately for each class meeting, and to think hard about the material that we’re reading and discussing. 

**Course Goals (i.e., what I hope you remember 5 years from now):**
- You will learn that religion is everywhere. It’s embedded into cultures, laws, practices, and policies. It’s also connected to every other subject that you will study at Lawrence. (I promise.)
- You will also learn that “religion” has broad meanings, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that religion can be defined however you want it to be defined. 
- This course will also prepare students for upper-level work in religious studies courses, and it will help students learn how to develop and present coherent arguments through writing and speech.

**Required Readings:**
- All readings will be posted as PDFs in this webpage.
- You are required to bring the assigned reading with you to every class meeting. (It doesn’t matter to me whether you print out your readings or save them electronically, as long as you bring them to class.)

**Technology Policy:**
This course relies on technology. With this in mind, laptops, tablets, and phones are welcome (and even encouraged) in class. The only caveat is that you use them only for class-related activities. In other words, you are welcome to use these devices to refer to class readings, type notes, or post relevant questions or comments on the readings. You should not, however, use these tools to read your email, check Facebook, watch cat videos, etc. Any misuse of technology by one student may result in the banning of electronics in class for all students, which would be pretty sad for everybody. So try to be cool about this, ok?

Sometimes when you’re working with computers, things can go wrong. Computers crash, files become corrupt, and servers go down. These are normal aspects of working with technology, and will not be acceptable excuses for late work or missed assignments. Please be sure to regularly back up your work and complete your assignments well enough in advance that you can avoid these problems.


**Policy on late assignments:**
This course has been designed with your stress levels in mind, and it is in your best interest to submit work on time. That said, I understand that sometimes things come up that may interfere with your ability to submit quality work in a timely manner.

I am happy to grant a two-day (48-hour) extension for assignments, provided that you contact me email at least 24 hours in advance of the assignment’s due date. You do not need to provide any reason or excuse for an extension request; a simple message indicating that you will be submitting your work after the assigned deadline is sufficient. Late assignments without advance notice will be subject to a full letter grade deduction for each 24-hour period that it is late. (e.g., An A- paper that is submitted between one minute and 24 hours late will be reduced to a B-, etc.)

Please note that this policy does not extend to in-class presentations, nor will it apply to your in-class midterm or take-home final exam. If you have any questions about this policy, please do not hesitate to ask in class, or discuss it with me privately.

At this point, I’d like to try a little experiment to see how many of you have made it this far into the syllabus. Technically, this is your first assignment, and you will get credit for this! Perform a Google image search for Milli Vanilli, the German R&B duo from the late 80's. Email me your favorite photo from the results. (Bonus points if you can name their hit single and tell me why they lost their Grammy Award.)


**Course Requirements**
- Art Museum Project (30%) 
In the first few weeks of the term, we will spend some time investigating religious art. More information about this project will be provided in class, but a basic breakdown of the assignment involves the following activities:
•	Selection and short write-up of three images (10%), due Friday of Week 2 (April 7). Students will write 1-2 paragraphs on each image that they have selected, and share them with classmates in class. Write-ups will be submitted to the class via a special Slack channel.
•	5-page paper on one image (20%), due Friday of Week 4 (April 21). Students will be assigned an image and will expand their original paragraphs into a longer essay. Papers will be submitted to Connie as a direct message in Slack.

- Mid-term Exam (20%)
As a class, we will create questions for the mid-term exam on Monday of Week 6 (May 1), and the exam will occur in class on Wednesday of Week 6 (May 3).

- Group Presentation (15%)
At the end of week 8, students will give group presentations based on the texts that we have covered so far. 

- Final take-home exam (20%)
Connie has to leave town for a conference during Week 10, so we will not meet during the last week of class. (Wow, aren’t you lucky!?) Instead, we will create questions for the exam together on Slack. A final take-home exam will be distributed on the last day of class, and exams must be submitted (as a direct message to Connie via Slack) no later than 2:00 on Wednesday, June 7.

- Participation (15%)
Students are expected to come to class with questions, comments, or other insights about the day’s assigned reading. Questions or comments can be posted on Slack or asked in class, but every student is expected to contribute in some way to every class meeting. Missing class or failing to participate in more than a couple of class meetings will result in a deduction of your participation grade. If you tend to be on the quieter side, or if you are worried about having time to state your comment or question in class, you are encouraged to participate via Slack!
